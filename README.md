This code is sent to our marketing site via the CDN jsdelivr, [here are the docs](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh). Each file is sent separately to support the import statements, but you could choose to combine them. Then in webflow you enter design mode, visit the page you want them on, and add them as script tags with the src as the url and `type="module"`

When you make changes to your public repositroy hosting the scripts for your cdn, you can visit [this website to clear the CDN cache](https://www.jsdelivr.com/tools/purge). This instantly updates the js being delivered to your page to make testing faster, but you will be throttled if you do it too much.
